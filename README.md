# CEDAE Data Science Project

## Introduction

CEDAE is the coorporation that provides drinking water and wastewater services for the city of Rio de Janeiro.
They provide plenty of data for the press and for the population, due to a law imposed by the Ministry of Health of Brazil.

There is data for physical, chemical and biological parameters of the drinking water of all ETAs (Estações de Tratamento de Água, or _Water Treatment Stations_).
In specific, the Guandu is the largest ETA of the world, providing drinking water for the municipalities of Nilópolis, Nova Iguaçu, Duque de Caxias, Belford Roxo, São João de Meriti, Itaguaí, Queimados and Rio de Janeiro.

## Data

The data is in PDF form. We would like to convert this PDF into CSV so that we can vizualize it better in [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).

All this data is publicly available [here](https://cedae.com.br/qualidadeagua).
